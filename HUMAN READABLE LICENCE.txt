Human-Readable Summary of the PolyForm Small Business License 1.0.0 (SBL)
The PolyForm Small Business License (SBL) 1.0.0 allows small businesses and individuals to use your software for free, but larger businesses must pay for a separate license. Here’s what it means in simple terms:

✅ You Can:
✔ Use the software for free if your business makes less than $1 million per year.
✔ Modify the software for personal or small business use.
✔ Share the software with others, as long as they also follow this license.

🚫 You Cannot:
❌ Use it for free if your business makes $1 million or more per year—you must buy a separate license from the creator.
❌ Sell the software or use it as part of a paid product without permission.
❌ Remove or change the license terms when distributing the software.

⚠ Important Notes:
There are no warranties or guarantees—you use this software at your own risk.
If your business grows and earns $1 million or more, you must stop using it for free and get a commercial license.
You can contact the creator for licensing options if you need commercial use.

Example Scenario:
Jane, a freelancer: ✅ Can use the software for free.
Bob's Bakery (small business earning $500k/year): ✅ Can use the software for free.
TechCorp Inc. (earns $5M/year): ❌ Cannot use it for free—must buy a commercial license.
